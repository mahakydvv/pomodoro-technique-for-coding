## 👩‍💻 What is the Pomodoro Technique?

Created by Francesco Cirillo, this method breaks work into:

Repeat this 4 times, then take a **longer break** (15–30 mins).

Simple? Yes.
Effective? Depends on *you*.

## 🧪 Our Take: Does It Really Work?

It **can** — if:
- You’re a solo coder needing structure
- You’re prone to doom-scrolling or context-switching
- You want to make the most of short focus windows

It might **not** — if:
- You’re in the coding *zone* and hate being interrupted
- Your tasks need 1+ hours of uninterrupted thought

Best advice? ✨ *Customize the Pomodoro rules to fit YOU.*
